# Zotero Annotation Viewer

A simple Streamlit-based tool to browse and visualize your Zotero annotations.

Please be aware that this is far from perfect and there are many improvements that could be made. Especially when it comes to error handling. But please feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you have suggestions for improvements.


## üìñ Overview

This tool allows you to:
- View and filter annotations from a specific Zotero collection.
- Navigate through the annotations and their corresponding PDFs.
- Filter annotations based on:
  - Tags
  - Highlight color
  - Reference year
  - Paper

So it converts this:
![Zotero Annotations](docs/zotero_annotations.png)

Into this (automatically opens in your browser):
![Zotero Annotation Viewer](docs/zotero_annotation_viewer.png)
